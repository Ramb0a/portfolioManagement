# Pharam R&D Portfolio Management

As we look across industries, time and again we find the same phenomena.What we perceive to be titans of industry, making long and short term decisions based on an a dazzling mix of intuition and experience, is in reality very different. Instead of corporations run by a group of singular personalities with incredible vision and foresight, instead we have beauracrats that missed thier calling as career politicians, staying just long enough with a corporation to ensure they never pay penalty for the terrible decisons they make. By the time a direction has come to roost, the decision makers in corporations all over the globe have already taken a new seat in the endless game of musical chairs. 

Thus it is no surprise when we read of the industry that leaders are notinvoking strategic thinking across the R&D portfolio: 

> The problem is that most R&D portfolio planning approaches are primarily short-term budgeting tools, not strategic ones...this lack of well articulated, long-term aspirations supported by quantitative metrics creates challenges for executives who want to enact a long-term focused R&D strategy...

It is no secret that bringing a single drug to market costs pharmaceutical companies $3B+ and over ten years.
